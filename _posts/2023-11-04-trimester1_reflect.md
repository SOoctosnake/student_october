In the College Board's AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course, I've gained valuable insights and skills that extend beyond coding and programming. Beyond the technical aspects, here's what I've learned:

1. **Computational Thinking**: I developed a structured approach to problem-solving, allowing me to break down complex challenges into smaller, manageable parts.

2. **Data Handling**: I learned to understand how data is processed, stored, and utilized in various formats, which is crucial in today's data-driven world.

3. **Internet Principles**: I grasped fundamental concepts about the internet and its functioning, providing a foundation for digital literacy.

4. **Ethical Considerations**: I explored the ethical and social implications of technology, understanding the importance of responsible use and ethical decision-making.

5. **Collaboration**: Working on group projects, I realized the significance of effective communication and teamwork, which are critical in any field.

Regarding communication with my team, I've identified areas where I could improve:

1. **Active Listening**: I could have been more attentive to my team members' ideas and concerns, making sure everyone felt heard.

2. **Timely Feedback**: Providing constructive feedback promptly helps address issues or improvements needed without causing delays.

3. **Clarification**: When I had questions or needed clarification, I should have been more proactive in seeking help or further explanation.

4. **Empathy**: Understanding my team members' perspectives and challenges allows for better collaboration and fosters a supportive environment.

5. **Clear Documentation**: I could have been more diligent in documenting project progress and decisions, ensuring transparency and accountability. Especially we did not really communicate while making the help and friends button which caused some problems

Improving communication is an ongoing process, and recognizing areas for enhancement is a crucial step towards becoming a more effective team member in both CSP and beyond.

I aim to learn more algorithms as well as getting better at agile methodology. I am excited for what Trimester 2 bring!
