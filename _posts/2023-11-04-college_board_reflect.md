# My preparation for the MC
- Reading back on all the team teaches really help me excel in the MCQ

# My thoughts on the MC
Taking the College Board's AP CSP multiple-choice exam with 66 questions was a challenging but valuable experience. It covered a wide range of computer science topics, from algorithms and data structures to internet security and ethical considerations. It assessed my knowledge, problem-solving skills, and the ability to apply computational concepts. The timed nature of the exam added an element of pressure, which simulated real-world scenarios. One thing I really learned while taking it was the importance on pseudo code. It is a universal language that everyone can understand. It also highlighted the importance of time management and critical thinking. Overall, it was an opportunity to demonstrate my understanding of computer science principles and, though challenging, helped to refine my skills and knowledge in this field.

# Topic used/learned in the MC

- Computational Thinking: The ability to analyze problems and design solutions using computational processes.

- Pseudo Code: Universal Language that everyone can understand

- Programming: Writing, testing, and debugging code in a programming language, such as Python or JavaScript.

- Algorithms: Understanding and creating step-by-step instructions for solving problems.

- Data Representation: Knowledge of how data is stored and manipulated in various formats (binary, text, etc.).

- Abstraction: Simplifying complex problems by focusing on high-level concepts and ignoring irrelevant details.

- Creativity: Developing innovative solutions to real-world problems using technology.

- Internet and Network Concepts: Understanding the basics of how the internet works and network protocols.

- Data Security and Privacy: Awareness of the importance of protecting data and respecting privacy in the digital age.

- Ethical and Social Implications: Exploring the societal impact of technology and considering ethical dilemmas.

- Debugging and Troubleshooting: Diagnosing and fixing errors in code.

- Testing and Validation: Checking that programs and algorithms work correctly and produce the desired results.

- Critical Thinking: Analyzing problems, breaking them down, and developing logical solutions.

- Documentation: Writing comments and documentation to explain code and make it more understandable for others.

## What I need to work on

I need to learn how to break down code and pseudo code
