The passion projects were really fun to see. They were an excellent way of demonstrating our code knowledge over the trimester. Working as a team in a frontend and backend simulated working conditions, which was fun. Presenting our work over all the weeks was also fun to see as we were enthusiastic about our different work. I am excited for next trimester to see what I can code.
